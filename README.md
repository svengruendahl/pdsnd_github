### Project Title
**Explore US Bikeshare Data**

### Description
**Overview**
In this project, you will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€” *Chicago*, *New York City*, and *Washington*.
You will answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
An interactive experience in the terminal allows you to present these statistics.

### Files used
**The Datasets**
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year

**Please note that you will need the three city dataset files too in order to run the program**:

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
